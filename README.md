Does GitHub show that both partners contributed substantially to the code?
  - Yes.
 
Does the page allow a poll to be created with one question and multiple answers?
  - Yes.

After the poll has been created, does the page allow votes to be cast?
  - Yes.

After votes have been cast, does the page allow them to be tallied?
  - Yes.

Is the user interface intuitive and easy to use?
  - It is somewhat awkward that the checkboxes appear before they're needed.
  - It is potentially problematic that inputs can be edited during voting.
  - It would be nice if the input boxes were longer so they could show more text at a time.
  - It would be nice to have clear confirmation that a vote has been cast successfully.
  - It would be nice if the winning result were highlighted in some way.

Is the page tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
  - Alignment and spacing need some work.
